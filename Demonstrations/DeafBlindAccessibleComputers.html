        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>
            Here's my elevator pitch of what this is— first, you need to know about DeafBlind people. You may be most familiar with Helen Keller, as 
            there's a solid chance you were taught about her in school. The gist is DeafBlind people have extremely limited vision and hearing. The 
            common response to help DeafBlind people access the same tools used by the rest of the world is through a care aide, but constantly relying 
            on another person is costly and difficult to support. I'm not the first to notice this issue, and I'd be committing a great injustice if I 
            did not immediately point you to <a href="https://tatumrobotics.com" style="font-size: 16px;"> tatum robotics</a> who inspired my journey 
            with this project. The idea of Tatum's device is to implement tactile sign language, i.e. sign language you feel with your hands, into the 
            hands of a robot, ensuring that there was no longer a need for an interpreter's constant presence. They've since made vast improvements, 
            but my project ventures into an area they have not yet completed— browsing the internet. The plan for my project is to create a chrome 
            extension that can intake information on a screen and turn that into robotic sign language.

            This project originally kicked off as a science fair project in my junior year of high school. With my lab partner I built a
