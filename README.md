# DeafBlind-Accessible-Computers
All code for my development of DeafBlind Accessible Computers

Every file in here is available for public usage. This software builds healthcare, so I must ask if you wish to edit it do not use it for profit. Please reach out to me if you have interest in helping with this project, or have connections to the DeafBlind community and would like to help.
